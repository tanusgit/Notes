Chapter 16: Integrating Functions of Several Variables 

This chapter discusses double and triple integrals in Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. 
The former Section 16.7 has been moved to the new Chapter 21. 

Chapter 17: Parameterization and Vector Fields 

This chapter discusses parameterized curves and motion, vector fields and flowlines. 

The former Section 17.5 has been moved to the new Chapter 21. 

Chapter 18: Line Integrals 

This chapter introduces line integrals and shows how to calculate them using parameterizations. Conservative 
fields, gradient fields, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, and Green’s Theorem are 
discussed. 

Chapter 19: Flux Integrals and Divergence 

This chapter introduces flux integrals and shows how to calculate them over surface graphs, portions of 
cylinders, and portions of spheres. The divergence is introduced and its relationship to flux integrals discussed 
in the Divergence Theorem. 

This new chapter combines Sections 19.1 and 19.2 with Sections 20.1 and 20.2 from the fifth edition 

Chapter 20: The Curl and Stokes’ Theorem 

The purpose of this chapter is to give students a practical understanding of the curl and of Stokes’ Theorem 
and to lay out the relationship between the theorems of vector calculus. 

This chapter consists of Sections 20.3-20.5from the fifth edition. 

Chapter 21: Parameters, Coordinates, and Integrals 

This new chapter covers parameterized surfaces, the change of variable formula in a double or triple integral, 
and flux though a parameterized surface.
